## dotfiles ##

This repo serves as a master collection of all my dotfiles. Each grouping has its own repo that is a submodule here. The install script will install all of the dotfiles in each submodule to the home folder when run. It also installs spf13-vim, cause I love it, and runs your updated `.bash_profile`.

### Install ###

    ./install
    
### Credits ####

Most stuff is original, but a lot of the aliases are ripped off from around the web. If you notice your idea in my repo somewhere and want credit, send me a note. Once I'm done rolling my eyes, I'll post a link or something.
