## dotfiles ##

This repo serves as a master collection of all my dotfiles. Each grouping has its own repo that is a submodule here. The install script will install all of the dotfiles in each submodule to the home folder when run.

### Dependencies ###

Nothing, really. Some aliases might not work without certain things installed, but it'll be pretty obvious. My tmux settings require [my bin files](https://github.com/jamestomasino/bin) to be installed somewhere in the path. You probably want ruby 1.9.3+, python 2.7+, and php 5.4+ installed. Vim 7.4 too.

### Install ###

From cloned git repo folder:

    $ ./install

### Update ###

From anywhere:

    $ shellupdate
   
### Credits ####

Most stuff is original, but a lot of the aliases and functions are ripped off from around the web. If you notice your idea in my repo somewhere and want credit, send me a note. Once I'm done rolling my eyes, I'll post a link or something.
